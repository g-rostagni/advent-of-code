# advent-of-code

python scripts for the advent of code challenges.

~~nothing is commented until I can be bothered to do so, so nothing will probably ever be commented. have fun decyphering these scripts~~

~~also I tend to overwrite code for part 1 when I do part 2, so most of these will only work for part 2 of their respective days.~~

I'm actually making an effort for the 2022 scripts, they should actually be readable


## /!\ 2023 UPDATE /!\
